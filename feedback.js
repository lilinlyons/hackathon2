// Cool project! I like that we can choose the product when we type in the search. Good idea. 
// I love that you practised using API fetching and localStorage.

// I just wish you use a database and server to make a project work, to practise with a bit. Maybe you could do login/logout and remember user's ingredients or favourite recipe. Also if you want you can play with styles a bit, now when you see all the recipes the styles are not stable :)
